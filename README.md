# image_to_minecraft
A very slow program I made to transform each pixel of an image into a minecraft item

You will need a minecraft texture pack or the default one, and put all the textures in a folder name "minecraft", don't need to filter or anything, just let the png in this folder.
I recommand for faster and better result to just use block & particle folder !
